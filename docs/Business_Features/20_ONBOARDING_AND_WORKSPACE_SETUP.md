## Business Value Proposition

The Onboarding and Workspace Setup process is the critical "First Mile" of the vDrive experience. It converts a sign-up into an active, value-generating business workspace. This flow automates the provisioning of secure environments, configures initial branding, and guides the user to their "Aha!" moment (uploading their first gallery).

### Key Business Benefits
- **Reduced Friction**: Streamlined wizard reduces drop-off rates during sign-up.
- **Instant Activation**: Automated provisioning allows immediate usage.
- **Personalized Setup**: Tailors the workspace to the photographer's specific business type (Wedding, Portrait, Event).
- **Compliance**: Ensures terms of service and privacy policy acceptance upfront.
- **Brand Identity**: Captures studio name and branding immediately, reinforcing professional value.

A multi-step, persistent form that guides the user through initial configuration.

#### Step 1: Business Identity

*   **Date Format**: Regional preference (DD/MM/YYYY vs MM/DD/YYYY).
*   **Preferred Language**: UI language for the dashboard (e.g., English, Hindi).

#### Step 3: Brand Basics (Optional)

### 4. The "First Mile" Checklist

2.  **Upload Logo** (if skipped).
3.  **Invite Team Member** (optional).
4.  **Connect Payment Gateway** (for collecting payments).
