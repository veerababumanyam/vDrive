> Terminology: See [`GLOSSARY.md`](GLOSSARY.md) (canonical terms for Workspace, Asset, Share Link, Trial, etc.).

**Last updated:** 27 Jan 2026  
**Owner:** Prasad Manyam  
**Company:** SWAZ Consultants  
**Product:** RawDrive  
**Status:** Draft v3 (Updated for Microservices)

---

## 1. Executive Summary

RawDrive is a multi-tenant platform for photographers, studios, and enterprise/corporate teams to manage the full media workflow end-to-end:

- **Ingest** (managed storage or BYOS), organize, and deliver photo/video galleries.
- **Collaborate** with clients and stakeholders via selections, comments, approvals, and proofs.
- **Produce** print and digital albums with a modern designer and print-safe exports.
- **Operate** the business with lead tracking, booking, contracts, and India-first payments.
- **Discover** content using AI-powered internal search (GEO): semantic metadata, embeddings, relationships, and personalized relevance.
- **Govern** enterprise media with SSO, policies, classification labels, retention/legal hold, and auditability.

RawDrive competes in an overcrowded market by combining three things most tools split across products:

1) client delivery + proofing, 2) album production, and 3) enterprise-grade governance/BYOS + AI discovery.

---

## 2. Product Principles (How we win)

1. **Client experience is the product.** Viewing, selecting, and approving must be effortless on mobile.
2. **Fast by default.** Galleries feel instant via progressive loading, caching, and derivatives.
3. **Trust and control.** Sharing is explicit, auditable, and policy-driven; no accidental leakage.
4. **BYOS without BYOS pain.** Users keep their storage; RawDrive provides the UX, metadata, search, and governance.
5. **AI that saves time, not creates work.** Background jobs, quotas/credits, clear previews, and reversible actions.

---

## 3. Target Users & Personas

1. **Photographer / Studio Owner**: delivers galleries, sells albums, runs bookings and payments.
2. **Client (Couple/Family)**: views, favorites, requests edits, approves album.
3. **Corporate Workspace Admin (Comms/HR/IT)**: SSO, roles, policies, retention, and security.
4. **Corporate Employee (Internal Viewer)**: secure portal access to internal galleries.
5. **External Guest / Agency**: time-boxed, scoped access with download rules.
6. **Platform Admin (RawDrive Ops)**: workspace support, abuse prevention, billing and monitoring.

---

## 4. Scope: What RawDrive ships

### 4.1 In scope

- Offline desktop album design tools (web-first only).
- External SEO growth product (GEO is internal AI discovery, not public SEO).

---

## 5. Success Metrics

### 5.1 Activation & retention

- $\ge 60\%$ of new signups upload a gallery within 48 hours.
- $\ge 40\%$ of active photographers share a client link within 7 days.
- $\ge 25\%$ of Business-trial users convert to paid within 30 days.

### 5.2 Client experience

- Median time-to-first-photo (client view) under 2 seconds on a typical 4G connection.
- $\ge 80\%$ of client sessions successfully complete at least one action (view, favorite, download, comment).

### 5.3 AI value

- $\ge 30\%$ reduction in time spent finding photos (self-reported and behavior proxies).
- Search “no result” rate under 5% for accounts with GEO scores $\ge 80$.

---

## 6. Core Concepts and Data Model (Product-level)

### 6.1 Workspace (Tenant) Model — resolves tenancy/RBAC inconsistencies

- A **Workspace** is the unit of tenancy and billing.
- A workspace can be:
  - **Photographer Workspace** (self-serve): one studio/photographer organization.
  - **Enterprise Workspace** (corporate): org hierarchy, policies, and governance.

**Rule:** every record that can contain customer data is scoped to exactly one workspace via `workspace_id` (legacy alias: `tenant_id` — avoid in new schemas/docs).

Implementation note (for cross-doc alignment): a “single-company” product experience is represented as a single workspace; isolation is still enforced by `workspace_id`, even if the UI is “one studio”.

### 6.2 Library objects

- **Gallery**: container for media; supports sub-galleries/sections.
- **Asset**: photo or video plus derivatives and metadata.
- **Client**: end-recipient identity for selections/comments and deliveries.
- **Album**: digital/print project containing spreads/pages.
- **Share Link**: capability-based access grant with policy rules and auditing.

---

## 7. Functional Requirements (By Domain)

### 7.1 Identity, Authentication, and RBAC

**Requirements**

- Support email/password sign-in and optional social auth (future), with MFA options.
- Enterprise: SAML/OIDC SSO, Just-in-Time provisioning, group-to-role mapping; SCIM is a later milestone.
- RBAC is workspace-scoped and permission-driven (bundles).
- Platform (Ops) admin roles are **global** and separate from workspace RBAC; cross-workspace customer data access requires explicit, audited support access.
- Fine-grained permissions cover: upload/manage media, create/share links, download originals, manage billing, manage policies, manage users, manage retention/legal hold.

**Acceptance criteria (high-signal)**

1. WHEN an authenticated user requests any workspace-scoped resource THEN the system SHALL enforce `workspace_id` authorization and deny cross-workspace access.
2. WHEN a role is updated THEN permissions take effect within 60 seconds for all active sessions.

---

### 7.2 Storage, Ingestion, and Sync (Managed + BYOS)

**Modes**

1. **Managed Storage** (default): Cloudflare R2 (or compatible object storage).
2. **BYOS**:

**Requirements**

- Workspace chooses storage mode (managed or BYOS) and provider.
- OAuth flows for Drive/Dropbox use least-privilege scopes and store tokens securely.
- File mapping and sync:
  - Maintain provider identifiers (folder IDs, file IDs), checksums, MIME types.
  - Background jobs reconcile external deletes/moves.
- Media access uses signed/temporary URLs; provider credentials are never exposed to clients.
- Support resumable uploads (where feasible) and background processing pipelines.

---
